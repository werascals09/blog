                <p class="post-text-lower"> I'll be honest I've never really used a Fujitsu laptop before so when this
                    arrived in over office I was like what's so special about this laptop the answer is portable design
                    plus OLED display I say these are the highlights of this laptop.
                    <br><br>

                    Because if you look for laptops with the older panels there's Asus vivobook k15 OLED which is a
                    budget option but it's not lightweight at 1.8 kgs then there are some other premium old laptops
                    there's the Dell XPS series which have the OLED option the recent galaxy book 2360 but these cost
                    more than one lakh rupees there is the zenbook flip on it but that too is at 85k starting price 70k
                    <br>
                <div class="postimgpic"><img src="../../../../../img/laptop/fizitsu vs.png" alt="">Source:
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkTUKlvVFlM">
                        Beebom</a>
                </div><br>
                and at that price OLED plus the portable design is an interesting combo I mean this is the
                laptop and the first thing that strike me about this laptop is its weight of 1.1 kg it's super
                lightweight this is the OLED version but there's another variant with an Exo display and that weighs
                even less than a kg as for the design this laptop has a very functional sort of design it has an
                aluminum chassis and the lid has this horizontal line and there's the Fujitsu logo the bottom is
                kind of usual with vents the dual speakers and this one long rubber fit all this is fine


                </p>

                <br>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>Display</b><br>
                    But the highlight is the OLED display these are the specs 60-hertz OLED display with 2.5 d glass on
                    top FHD resolution 100 dc ip3 coverage and 400 nits of peak brightness now I said this is the
                    highlight because the display quality is pretty amazing the colors look vibrant and nice the blacks
                    are very deep and watching movies and shows is a great experience it's also fairly bright so even
                    though this is a glossy display and it is reflective no doubts but the good brightness kind of
                    manages that the point is this all it makes sense for a work laptop like this one, one thing to note
                    along with this variant with an OLED display Fujitsu has also launched another variant with an Exo
                    display which is said to be 80 to 90 more power efficient when compared to LCDs while also bringing
                    the same good picture quality anyway the portability and the display are on point


                </p>

                </BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>Performance</b><br>
                    What about the rest of the laptop first let's check out the specs so this is an intel evo certified
                    laptop and comes with the 11 gen core i5 1135 g7 cpu with four cores eight threads 28 watt tdp and
                    this can go up to 4.2 gigahertz there's the iris x gpu 512 gb of m2 pci ssd and 16gb lpddr4x ram now
                    ram and ssd are sold but when we opened up the laptop we found that the ssd can be removed but this
                    will void your warranty so i wouldn't recommend doing this now i would have liked the latest 12 gen
                    intel chipsets but the 1135g7 is a capable processor for a work laptop like this one let me just
                    show you the geekbench score now as for the day-to-day performance
                    <br><br> the windows 11 boot time is
                    pretty good 13 seconds to log in and 16 seconds to desktop plus the laptop was a consistent
                    performance usage with a number of chrome tabs open videos playing apps like slack running in the
                    background the laptop obviously does not break a sweat there's no lag we also tested some photoshop
                    on it and the performance while editing a photo was good so the performance seems good and as for
                    the thermals they are decent for a laptop in this size there is only one fan that goes on turbo when
                    there is intense load on the cpu it doesn't make much noise so it's not too distracting and i also
                    noticed no weird heating when using the laptop or even during benchmarks performance support

                    <b>Design</b><br>
                    let me come back to the design and build quality of this laptop so like I said I love how
                    lightweight and easy to hold this laptop

                    but there are a couple of quirks about this design one there is this cutout here to open the lid but
                    you can't open the lid with just one hand second this cutout is in the center but if you look at it
                    from this angle the trackpad placement looks a bit weird yeah just OCD things the trackpad is also
                    quite small and it has these buttons which do look a bit dated although the response is good the
                    keyboard, on the other hand, is pretty good the keys are tactile with a lot of travel the feedback
                    is good the keys are backlit and even though the keys are a bit small the typing experience is very
                    good anyway the hinge is solid and I did not notice any major flex in the build if you're wondering
                    there's no fingerprint scanner here

                    USB a port which has the anytime charge functionality as you can see from the symbol this means that
                    with this port you can charge an external device even when the laptop is turned off pretty cool on
                    the left there's the headphone mic combo jack another Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port and an HDMI in plus
                    output I mean HDMI input mode is red in laptops and this means you can use this laptop as a display

                    battery life on this in our usage we saw estimated battery life of 6 hours 40 minutes which is
                    fairly good as for charging this comes with a 65-watt USB-C charger in the box and the laptop also
                    supports for power banks as long as they are higher than 7.5 watts apart from all

                    <b>Final Verdict</b><br>
                    This laptop is starting From 70k and for that price,
                    this is quite an interesting laptop there's obviously the beautiful OLED display and I like how
                    portable and light this laptop is the chipset is 11 gen but the

                    performance seems good so far the ports are super interesting with two thunderbolts 4 ports and an
                    HDMI 8 plus output now this is not a perfect laptop I feel the build quality could have been better
                    along with the trackpad and there's no fingerprint scanner so it all depends on the pricing
