                <p class="post-text-lower"> windows 11 laptops at 25 000 rupees what's the first word that comes to your
                    mind slow…. well Asus launched this new BR 1100 series of budget laptops and these laptops aim to
                    fix the windows 11 experience in the whole budget laptop segment the two laptops the BR 1100c which
                    is priced into piece 24,999 and this is what I'll be focusing on but there's also the BR 1100f which
                    is a two in one touchscreen laptop at 29,999 so let's get started so



                </p>

                <br>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>OverView</b><br>
                    this is the Asus BR 1100c and I know it looks kind of boxy and functional with the whole plastic
                    design but don't go by its looks this is a proper rugged design first of all this is a
                    military-grade certified laptop so it has gone through a number of tests and this design just feels
                    solid you can see the rubber bumpers around the device the lid and the bottom have a texture that's
                    scratch resistant there are these rubber feet on the bottom for better grip basically this is not
                    the best-looking laptop out there but


                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    the flip side is it should be fine with drops and bumps I mean
                    I noticed a little bit of flex here and there but other than that this feels well built and I like
                    that this whole design is modular and it can be easily opened for repairs and upgrades moreover this
                    is very portable it's compact and it's very lightweight at 1.26 kgs and you also get this led
                    indicator on the lid which by the way does not open with one hand now this is all fine



                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>Performance</b><br>
                    but let's get to the important factor it's the performance that matters in this price range so let's
                    check out the specs right away this has the intel celeron n4500 chipset which is a 10 animated
                    chipset dual cores and two threads it can go up to 2.8 gigahertz now this is fine but what's
                    interesting is that there's a gb gen 3 ssd here along with 4gb ddr4 ram now this is interesting
                    because even in 2022 a lot of laptops in the 25k segment come with either hdd storage or emc storage
                    or slower ram


                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    and they kind of become bottlenecks in the performance so it's good that asus has used an ssd along
                    with fast ram and as for the ssd's performance here's the crystal dismount benchmark score from the
                    laptop which shows that this is a standard gen3 ssd also one thing to note the ssd here is user
                    upgradable to up to 2 tb now here the benchmark scores from the laptop but other than that the user
                    experience on budget windows laptops is the biggest problem and that's where the BR 1100 laptops are
                    surprising i mean this is a laptop that won't handle heavyweight intensive apps and games but
                    day-to-day usage should be good first for the boot time of windows 11 in this laptop is 10 seconds


                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    to the login screen and 25 seconds to the desktop which is pretty good apart from that my usage
                    generally includes chrome slack some minor photo editing and this laptop handles that pretty easily
                    here's chrome with 10 tabs open and one of them is playing a video on 1080p and there's also notepad
                    and paint.net open in the background and you can see that the performance is good there's no stutter
                    lag while using the laptop switching between tabs the cpu usage is fine to around 25 to 35 percent
                    and the ram usage is in the 80 now if i play a 4k video some lag comes up and you can see the cpu
                    and ram usage increase in fact the cpu usage goes to 100


                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    but even then the laptop is usable we even tried some photoshop on it and doing some basic photo
                    editing with the single layer was kind of fine on this laptop although it won't handle heavy editing
                    no doubts about that if you're wondering the laptop comes with windows 11 home and the windows
                    experience is also good all around as for the thermals this is a fanless design so the laptop is
                    always silent but there is a vapor chamber cooling system in this laptop the point is most windows
                    laptops in this price range are unusable and this is actually something you can use it's not the
                    fastest windows laptop out there but at this price this brings a good windows 11 experience anyway
                    performance is important but so are the other basics of a budget laptop

                <p><b>Ports</b><br>

                    the port selection is good on the left you get a USB-C port which also supports charging a USB a
                    port HDMI Kensington lock slot and the power input the right has another USB a port ethernet I head
                    for my combo jack the power button and a physical volume rocker now there's no fingerprint scanner
                    or windows Zillow support
                </p>
                </p>

                <p><b>Camera</b><br>

                    but there is a 720p webcam here which has a 3d noise reducing feature and there are also webcams
                    that are built right into the design now this is the keyboard that you get and I like that it has a
                    dedicated key to mute the mic which students will find handy anyway this is a chicklet keyboard and
                    the travel is low but the typing feels smooth and nice thanks for the good tactile feedback the
                    trackpad is decently sized and it is smooth and it supports windows 11 gesture apart from this

                    <b>Display</b><br>
                    when it comes to display the Asus BR 1100 has an 11.6 inch led HD display and I'm not a big fan of
                    the big chunky bezels all around which make it look like an old laptop but Asus says that they kept
                    this bezel to accommodate a full keyboard and give the screen better protection in case of drops as
                    for display it's a matte display which looks decent when you look at it from the front from a side
                    angle it does look a bit washed out due to the average viewing angles and apart from that the colors
                    are fine and it's not the brightest but it gets the job done also display here can be tilted to 180
                    degrees like this

                    there are two speakers which like most speakers in this price range are kind of average the battery
                    is a 42 watt 3 cell battery and there is a 45 watt charger in the box now asus claims battery life
                    up to 10 hours

                    but practically this should last for 5-6 hours as for connectivity the laptop has wi-fi five with
                    dual band support and this bluetooth 4.2 a lot of people have doubts on the warranty of budget
                    laptops this comes with one ear one now


                </p>

                <p><b>Br-1100F</b><br>

                    the other BR 1100F laptop is a two in one laptop and has the
                    same specs as the usual one but it has a flip design with a glossy touch screen so you can use it as
                    a windows tablet and i like that this laptop has a stylus that's built right into the design in fact
                    this slot also charges the stylus as for the styluses performance is good and i noticed good palm
                    rejection too so you can easily draw and write on the screen plus this has an additional 13
                    megapixel camera that you can use in tablet mode to conclude things the asus BR 1100 series of
                    laptops is definitely interesting especially the BR 1100c which is price repeats 24,999 i mean 25k
                    there are only a few options of windows laptops with ssds and that's what this makes sense i mean
                    you saw it in action this actually brings a good usable windows 11 experience for this price

                    <b>Final Verdict</b><br>
                    it's not a perfect laptop I think Asus could have cut down the bezels and the design could have been
                    a little more appealing but I like the rugged features and the portability of the design I also
                    liked the other basics you expect in a laptop seem fairly on point be the keyboard the ports or the
                    trackpad so this seems like a good value for money laptop right so what do you think about these new
                    BR 1100 series of budget laptops.
