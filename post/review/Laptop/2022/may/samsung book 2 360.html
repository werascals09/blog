                    trying to
                    fix, that this is the new Galaxy Book 2 360 that launched recently in India and
                    this brings some cool features good specs but it also shows us Samsung's
                    ecosystem features in action so yeah


                </p>

                <br>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>OverView</b><br>
                    let's get into it so the looks this laptop speaks class from all the angles it's got a metal
                    build which looks quite minimal and nice.
                    I also like that this aluminum finish is not a big fingerprint magnet and has this soft-touch feel
                    which makes this The whole design stands out as one thing that
                    What surprised me though is how sleek and light this is it is 12.9 millimeters
                    thick and weighs only 1.19 kgs I mean i was comparing it with the MacBook air
                    and turns out the galaxy book 2 360 is slimmer and lighter plus this is a two
                    in one laptop and the hinge feels solid so far which is very important because


                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    you're gonna use it in tablet mode tent mode and even in this stand mode I mean
                    I've been using this laptop in a tablet mode a lot and the hinge seems reliable
                    in fact, the lid here can be lifted with one hand which is impressive because
                    generally, light laptops two-in-one laptops can't really do this this design is also mostly solid
                    but I did notice a very minor flex on the keyboard it's not a big deal but yeah other than that this
                    feels like a very well-built laptop it has the MIL-STD-810G certification for
                    military-grade durability.



                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>Ports</b><br>
                    the port selection is good too there's a micro sd slot on the left along with the mic
                    headphone jack and a USB port on the right there is an HDMI port a USB-C port
                    and a thunderbolt 4 USB c port so it's not only thinner than the MacBook air it
                    also has more ports than the MacBook air yeah garage there's also a fingerprint
                    scanner in the power button which is fast and nice.

                <p><b>Speaker</b><br>

                    the speakers are on the bottom and there are two of them and as for the quality, they're kind of
                    okay the clarity is good but the loudness could have been better

                    <b>Display</b><br>
                    Display you have the specs now in a two in one the screen matters a lot and this
                    is a super AMOLED panel and it looks like a super AMOLED panel I mean the
                    The first time I saw the screen it just reminded me of the AMOLED displays on
                    Samsung phones it's just a premium display with very good colors great
                    blacks and a lot of us use two in one laptops so multimedia and this display
                    makes sense for that

                    <!-- <b>Design & Looks</b><br> -->
                    another good thing is that this is a very responsive touch screen so i
                    actually, like using this in tablet mode there's also s pen support, and Samsung selling that
                    separately but I did try the s22 ultra s pen on this and it's a good experience but the palm
                    rejection could have been better now one quirk about this display is that it's a fairly
                    the reflective screen I mean the brightness is good but you can see the reflections
                    on it

                    let's talk about the specs now the galaxy book 2 360 is an intel Evo certified laptop and it comes
                    with the latest 12 gen intel chipsets the variant we have has the 10-nanometer core i7
                    1255u CPU with 10 cores 12 threads iris xc graphics 15-watt tdp and there's 512
                    GB of gen 3 PCI SSD and 16 GB lp ddr4x ram if you're wondering about ddr5 ram
                    that's only present in the pro variants anyway I did run some benchmarks on the
                    laptop to give you an idea so here's the geekbench score

                <p><b>Optimisation</b><br>
                    apart from the performance of the laptop seems fast and snappy I mean i
                    was able to get through 10 tabs on the edge with 8k video playing smoothly and there
                    were no hiccups honestly I've only used this laptop for a day so it's too early
                    to judge for me but the laptop beat in the usual laptop mode or in the tablet
                    mode feels smooth the laptop comes with windows 11 on
                    board with Microsoft office bundled with it but what's really cool is the

                <p><b>Ecosystem | It is a deal maker</b><br>

                    ecosystem features the laptop actually comes with this galaxy book experience
                    the app that shows you all the cool connected features between the galaxy
                    book 2 a galaxy phone and a galaxy tablet and even galaxy earbuds first of
                    all the second screens lets you use a galaxy tab as a secondary screen along
                    with the galaxy book 2. there's also multi-control which is a lot like apple's universal control and
                    it lets you use the laptop's keyboard and mouse on the tablet seamlessly but it only
                    works with tablets that have the one UI 4.1 update so we could not really try
                    that plus there all the features like quick share to share files between
                    Samsung devices wirelessly and it automatically converts files in case the
                    other device does not support that file format there's also a private share to send
                    private files that nobody can share or take a screenshot of the smart switch to
                    move files from your old laptop to this one click pairing with the galaxy buds
                    and there's also the link to windows with all the cool features like
                    clipboard sharing notification mirror the option to use android apps on the
                    laptop so the galaxy book 2 360 is feature-packed when it comes to
                    ecosystem features and if you have a Samsung phone, Samsung tablet, Samsung earphones the experience
                    is going to be amazing for you

                    <b>Keaboard And Touchpad</b><br>
                    as for the other basics of the laptop, the touchpad and the keyboard are some of the best I've used
                    on a Windows laptop, this is the trackpad and it's very smooth and responsive the
                    keyboard is very good too it is a standard backlit chiclet-style keyboard but I like how the keys
                    are well spaced out and even though the key travel is not a lot it's okay because the keys are
                    super crisp the tactile feedback is good and it just feels very clicky I did feel the keys are a bit
                    too flat because I'm used to the curvy keys on the MacBook
                    but overall this just feels like a keyboard that will be fun to type on it.

                    <b>Battery </b>
                    <br>
                    The battery is a 61 wattage battery and i haven't had the time to test out the
                    battery but Samsung rates it for 21-22 hours of video playback the charger is a
                    A 65-watt USB-C charger it looks pretty nice and since it is a PD charger you can fast charge your
                    other devices too

                    <b>Camera</b><br>

                    The 720p webcam is on the top and the webcam is nothing special but Samsung
                    has these cool features to blur the background smooth in the face there's also, this auto framing
                    feature which zooms in on your face and makes sure to track your face to keep it in the center

                    and the core i7 variant we have cost rupees 1,05990.

                    <b>Final Verdict</b><br>
                    So this is a premium, high-end laptop from Samsung and I quite
                    like it I mean I'm here to test things out extensively and compare them with
                    other laptops in this price range but there are many things I like about this
                    the design looks very understated and the premium I love how lightweight and sleek this
                    a laptop is a Super AMOLED display is absolutely gorgeous and I love the cool
                    ecosystem features that Samsung is bringing I also like the keyboard track
                    pad and the poor selection are on point so this seems pretty cool so far but i
                    want to know your opinion on this laptop
