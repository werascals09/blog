                <p class="post-text-lower">So this is Samsung m53 5g but there's one small thing Samsung M52 5g sells on
                    Amazon for ₹24,999,
                    And the Samsung M53 5g has a price of ₹26,499 so which one to pick
                    of course Samsung M53 Junaid. it's the new one right well there's one small
                    thing and by the way 2021 versus 2022 smartphones would be a good topic.

                <p>
                    <b>Unboxing</b><br>
                    let's go now the box has gotten a smaller flagship-like,
                    experience all the way on a serious road
                    there's no charger in the box in the previous m52 you did get a 15 watt
                    the charger now gets a bit dicey when in budget or mid-range phones you don't get
                    a charger because this ₹26,499 phone will have to include the charger cost as well
                    so I went on Amazon to check how much does a 25-watt adapter costs,
                    and if you
                    go and buy a Samsung phone and go down here add accessories and a charger
                    you can add a 25-watt charger for 298 rupees so I confirmed with Samsung if
                    you buy a charger along with the phone it costs ₹298 else it cost ₹1,149
                    something like that so a wise deal,
                    <br><br>
                    Oh by the way few paperwork and a
                    sim ejector tool and USB type c to type c cable now build quality is where i
                    would say there is a minor change like the m53 has this smooth matte kind of
                    finish you can see a bit of fingerprint but it's fine it has a plastic bag
                    like last year and it has a side-mounted fingerprint scanner this

                    time which can be In-display for this price and the speed is good like any other physical
                    fingerprint scanner.

                <h3>Speaker</h3>
                <p>

                    like last year you get a single speaker it actually has good
                    clarity and even if you listen to dialogues or vocals that sound pretty
                    good but it's not as loud as a stereo speaker
                </p>
                </p>

                <br>
                <p class="post-text-lower">
                <h3>Display </h3>
                <p>

                    this is where you will see an upgrade like this is 6.7 inches 120 hertz
                    full HD super AMOLED plus display now it is Samsung it is one of the best
                    displays in the segment plus is the interesting
                    part Samsung this year will be shipped with a super AMOLED plus
                    display that's the new upgrade to super AMOLED so super AMOLED plus is
                    brighter sharper and uses less energy so.
                    <br><br> @Techwiser used a device that tells
                    your brightness of the display numbers called
                    nits and this is a white screen at full brightness on both the displays
                    and this
                    is Samsung m52 and it scores about 523nits and this m53 scores about 564 nits
                    so it's a bit bright than m52 and even in real life outdoors in bright sunlight
                    you can see the m53 looks brighter.

                <p>
                    now the biggest change this year is dimensity 900 6gb lpddr4x ram 128GB UFS 2.2
                    storage now
                    *last year you had snapdragon 778g and you would be like Junaid in this term 53
                    That sounds like a downgrade to me well if you look at the antutu scores m52 is
                    better than m53 but processors are a bit tricky to understand than that let me

                    simplify the Samsung m52 with snapdragon 778g has a better CPU the Samsung m53
                    with dimensity 900 has a better GPU so

                    how does that affect you in day-to-day life well using social media browsing
                    web watching videos nothing does not take a lot.
                    <br><br> But
                    *if you play games let me show you in BGMI so you can play smooth graphics
                    extreme fps or max you can go ultra fps hdr graphics
                    let's play in extreme fps because
                    why not of course enemy sound I can see a few frames drops here and
                    there and if I'm not dying the gameplay is good decent I would say but
                    BGMI is a popular game if you play some other games like call of duty see
                    snapdragon has better game support you can go
                    very high graphics at highest frame rates like you can see whereas on
                    MediaTek if you have to go max frame rates you have to switch to low graphics
                    so if gaming is your priority generally you should prefer snapdragon.

                <h3>Camera</h3>
                <!-- <br> -->
                <p>
                    is where Samsung has one of the best camera software
                    processing and one of the best cameras in the segment and now you get a
                    108-megapixel main sensor on the m53 so I'm expecting the photos to be a lot
                    sharper this time like the first thing I noticed was that the Samsung m53 takes a lot of
                    cooler photos whereas m52 take warmer photos if you look at this picture
                    or if you look at these trees and all the leaves falling down it's cooler on m53
                    it's warmer on m52 and about the sharpness, it's more or less the same like
                    if you zoom into this manus picture m52 is sharper.
                    <br> <br>
                    Now have an 8-megapixel ultra
                    wide-angle camera compared to 12 megapixels from the last year so I thought the
                    photos should come out less sharp but again in outdoor light conditions both
                    photos were more or less the same so the rear camera I think it's more
                    or less the same as this here you get a couple of good photo features in the
                    m53 series like this object eraser so a lot of times you take photos and there
                    are unwanted people in the images which you want to remove later on so here i
                    can go and just draw a line around the person and just tap on erase and it does a
                    really good job of removing the person from this picture.
                    <br> <br>
                    * but the major difference is with the selfie camera like you get a 32-megapixel selfie
                    camera but the software processing is improved quite a lot like in my photos i
                    found out the skin tone to be a lot more accurate on the m53 and even
                    a dynamic range like if you look at this photo the hdr performance and all is
                    better on Samsung m53 and of course, you get a 2-megapixel depth
                    camera and 2-megapixel macro camera for symmetry and Samsung gives you the option to
                    record 4k 30 fps video on the front camera as well as the main sensor and if you
                    want to record videos on all three sensors wide-angle main and selfie camera then you will
                    have to switch to 1080p 30 30fps.

                <p><b>Software </b><br>
                    is something I would be like wow one UI best well the phone comes with android 12 right out
                    of the box, Samsung is promising two years of Android updates and four years of security
                    updates for m series phone so both m52 and m53 have android 12 the only thing is m52 will
                    only receive updates till android 13 whereas m53 will receive updates until
                    android 14. rest you get full one UI 4.1 secure folder screen recorder hardware
                    knocks everything and a very small thing to note is Samsung m53 has
                    Samsung pay mini now if you don't know Samsung pay mini only supports UPI you
                    cannot add your cards to it
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And
                    there is a very interesting call feature like

                    I tried standing beside a big ac and there should be a lot of fan noise so there is a
                    a feature called intelligent voice focus which is now on and it uses AI to enhance
                    your voice and remove all the background noises.

                    also, you do get a few bloatware which you can uninstall like this and there's
                    also, a discover tab which you can just go to settings and disable
                </p>

                <p><b>Battery and Sensors </b>
                    <br>you
                    get a 5000 MAH battery like last year you can fast charge it at 25 watts the
                    the charger you have to buy it separately you get all the important sensors you get

                    12 bands of 5g which is more than enough I also check 4g plus with my jio sim
                    and it works really well there's
                    also, a discover tab which you can just go to settings and disable

                <p class="post-text-lower">
                <p><b>Final Verdict </b>
                    <br>now if you look at 2022 smartphone launches
                    the M53 is a good launch for better updates a better selfie camera one year of extra
                    android update you can consider Samsung M53 5g we'll definitely be doing an
                    review or comparison with other phones.
