                <p class="post-text-lower">So here's the realme pad mini and it looks like a smaller version of the
                    realme pad which is not a bad thing there's the same aluminum finish with the realme logo at the
                    bottom although these lines which are probably antenna bands are horizontal on the top and the
                    bottom as for the weight and size this is pretty sleek at 7.6 millimeters thickness and it's 372
                    grams in weight.

                <p>
                    <b>Difference</b><br>
                    Now one of the big differences between this and the bigger realme pad is obviously the size here are
                    both the tablets and you can see that the mini is much smaller in fact holding the mini pad meaning
                    the hands feel like holding a slightly bigger phone I mean this size is just much easier to use as
                    for the functionality there's the power button and the volume buttons on the side the headphone jack
                    is here and there's a dual sim plus micro sd hybrid slot yeah this is the LTE variant and there is a
                    phone app here so you can make calls on it.

                    <!-- <h3>Display </h3> -->
                <p>
                    <b>Display</b><br>
                    The screen is an 8.7 inch IPS LCD which is close to hd and to be honest the display is an area where
                    it does feel like a low-end tablet see I would have liked the same high resolution as the redmi pad
                    screen but this is a lower price device so really hard to cut corners in the display now this
                    display has its positives for example the bezels are not too big the colors look decent and there's
                    an option in display settings called video display enhancement which works in apps like youtube and
                    this does make the display a bit more vivid when playing videos which is good the tablet also has
                    the wide wine l1 license and movies and shows and apps like netflix run it hd so no problems here
                    about home days the blacks are good too as far as lcd panels go and i noticed that even though this
                    is not the brightest display it's still brighter than the bigger real me pad as you can see from
                    this comparison and as for the negatives of the display the viewing angles are kind of average and
                    the low resolution is also noticeable sometimes if you ask me these aren't exactly deal breakers at
                    this price point now the display does not have stylus support
                    <br>
                    and there's no keyboard case just like the bigger really bad

                <p>
                    <b>Design & Looks</b><br>
                    the Xiaomi pack design is kind of inspired by the modern ipads with the square edges
                    aluminum frame the narrow bezels on the front the back has this glass-like
                    a polished finish that is actually plastic as for the in-hand feel this
                    looks and feels like a premium tablet but this is an 11-inch tablet so you have to
                    use it with two hands the size and weight is on par with that tablets.

                <p><b>Speaker</b><br>
                    when it comes to speakers there are dual speakers in a top and bottom config and they are direct
                    audio certified and there's also adaptive surround sound the speakers here are fairly loud not as
                    loud as quad speakers obviously but it's good for the quality it does get a little flat at max
                    volumes but other than that it's fairly crisp and nice

                    <b>Performance</b>
                    <br> Now what I really liked about the realme pad mini is that realme hasn't compromised the
                    performance on this tablet these are the specs and the uni soc t616 is basically the same chipset as
                    the t610 we also saw in the Nokia t20 tablet and that means it's almost on par with the MediaTek g80
                    on the bigger enemy pad I mean here are the benchmarks and like i said the pad mini scores are very
                    close to the og really bad beating android 2 or geek bench which is really good I also checked for
                    CPU throttling and the performance was very good as you can see the real-world performance of this
                    tablet is pretty good too the usual apps like chrome facebook Instagram youtube all work without any
                    lag or stutter and there is some lag when the battery goes low but other than that the performance
                    is good moving on to the gaming performance it's oakish asphalt and its default graphics settings
                    was a little inconsistent laggy at times but lowering the graphics mostly fixes that same with cod
                    and is the same with BGMI, BGMI supports hd and high settings are smooth and high and at hd the game
                    was not very smooth but at smooth graphics the performance is a lot better and much more playable
                    this is also because the software

                <p><b>Software</b><br>
                    Here is very minimal there's realme of a pad based on android 11 and it's the same experience as the
                    big really bad i mean it's not the usual feature which really ui it's fairly bare bones but it was
                    the same with the redmi pad so i guess it's okay plus this ui has its advantages there's no
                    bloatware apps no ads no weird lock screen features it's all clean and nice now there are useful
                    things like the kit space from google and the youtube kids app if you plan on buying this tablet for
                    your kid apart from that it's pretty much the phone ui expanded for a tablet you can put apps into
                    split screen from the recent screen but there's no docker gesture the navigation gestures from
                    android are here but like on the realme pad you can't switch between app by swiping on the bottom i
                    mean this should have been fixed right what do you think plus there's no promise of updates i mean
                    you asked realme and they said that they'll be pushing out security updates frequently which
                    basically means no major android updates i mean i know that this is a budget android tablet but at
                    least it deserves android 12. so the software remains kind of simple

                    <b>Camera</b><br>
                    coming to the cameras there's an 8 megapixel camera on the rear and a 5 megapixel camera on the
                    front honestly it's high time companies prioritize the front cameras and tablets because that's
                    going to be used a lot more anyway the front camera only shoots 720p video and the front 5 megapixel
                    camera of the realme pad mini and i know the quality looks kind of oakish

                    <b>Battery </b>
                    <br>
                    Thee battery is a 6400 MAH and there is this 80 watt charger in the box which is really good for
                    this price range now we did a couple of tests on the battery we played a youtube video at 1080p with
                    the screen set to match brightness and volume at 60 for an hour and the battery drain was 14% which
                    i think is pretty good we also played cod mobile at the max settings established supports for an
                    hour and the battery drain was 21% so the battery performance seems fairly good so far on the realme
                    pad mini and one thing to note the device does not ever get too hard when it comes to general usage
                    or even gaming

                    <b>Final Verdict</b><br>
                    now if i'm being honest with you if you are okay with bigger 10 inch tablets and if you have a
                    slightly higher budget i'd still recommend you the realme pad the bigger one it's still a better
                    device but if you want a smaller tablet and your budget is slightly lower this still is a very good
                    option i also say this because if you compare the realme pad mini to the galaxy tab a7 lite and the
                    moto tab g20 the realme pad mini looks better the moto tablet is the lightest the realme pad mini is
                    the slimmest but very importantly the real me pad mini's uni soc t616 is more powerful than the
                    helio p22t it also has faster ufs 2.1 storage compared to emc storage on the samsung and the moto
                    tab it also has the better front camera a bigger battery and a faster charger in the box sure the
                    software on the tab a7 lite will probably be better because it's samsung but i will take better
                    performance so overall the realme pad mini is good value for money although i still think they'll be
                    should give at least one major android update for this
