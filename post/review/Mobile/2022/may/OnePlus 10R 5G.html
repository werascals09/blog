                <p class="post-text-lower">A lot has been happening with oneplus off rate but let's face it phones like
                    the oneplus 9r or even the oneplus 9rt are good smartphones so when I heard about the launch of the
                    oneplus 10r I was kind of looking forward to it but when this finally arrived I was kind of
                    speechless and not in a good way I mean just look at this phone this can't be one plus I mean this
                    does not look like a oneplus phone does it see no matter what your opinion of oneplus phones is


                </p>

                <br>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>Design & Look</b><br>
                    I think you will agree when I say that almost all oneplus phones looked elegant and premium the 9
                    series the 8 series or 7 series oneplus phones have always looked classy but this I can't say the
                    same about the oneplus 10 just look at the oneplus 10r it has these lines on the back which is
                    something I would expect real me and oppo to do not oneplus it's not just the speed pad look at the
                    camera bump which first of all looks super ugly.


                </p>
                </p>
                <BR>
                <br>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    I mean it makes the oneplus 10 pro look kind of good now it's not just the looks this glass module
                    is a huge huge fingerprint magnet this is how it looks like after you've used the phone for a bit
                    honestly it looks kind of cheap now these apart the whole boxy design is not something you associate
                    with oneplus i get it everyone's moving to flat size like on the iphone but on the iphone it looks
                    good because it's metal the oneplus 10r has a plastic frame which makes it look and feel like a
                    budget phone and even though this is only 8.2 millimeters thick it looks and feels like a very very
                    thick phone plus over the frame you can see the screen kind of bulging out which makes it look even
                    more uneven the point is this whole design just does not look one plus like i mean he's the oneplus
                    9rt next to the oneplus 10r


                </p>

                    <p>

                        And it's kind of obvious the 9rt looks way more premium and it looks like a phone that costs 40k
                        and
                        the 10r looks like a phone that would be around 20k forget the 9rd just put the 10r next to any
                        recent oneplus phone and it will always stand out and not in a good way now maybe you are in a
                        forgiving mood sir like it's fine it's just the looks who cares I'll put a case on it it's fine
                        but
                        how will you forgive oneplus for not putting in the iconic alert slider in a 40k rupee phone yes
                        this phone does not have the alert slider I was just not expecting this

                        I know it hurts like oneplus does not want to be light anymore see the problem is the oneplus
                        10r is
                        a wholly unoriginal smartphone I think you already know this but the oneplus 10r is basically
                        the
                        real me gt neo3 rebranded as you can see from this comparison the oneplus 10r is basically the
                        same
                        phone as the gt neo3 same display same cameras same battery same 80 watt and 150-watt charges so
                        let
                        me save you some time.

                    </p>
                    </p>
                    <br>


                    <p class="post-text-lower">
                    <p>
                        <b>Performance</b><br>
                        So first of all the oneplus 10r has the diminishing 8100 max chipset which is basically the 8100
                        with some behind the scene changes from oneplus and MediaTek now going to oneplus the max weight
                        into the 8100 brings better thermals lower power usage and better GPU performance but when I ran
                        some benchmarks on the 10r it actually scored lower than the gt neo3 in antutu as well as
                        geekbench
                        it did do better in the 3d market so maybe the jeep is actually faster on the max weighted i
                        also
                        ran the CPU throttling test app on the 10r and the gt new 3 and in the 30 minutes 50 threads
                        test
                        both the phones did well as you can see from this course i also checked the temperatures and
                        they
                        were both pretty normal but the 10r lost more battery I started the test with both phones at
                        100%
                        and the 10r lost 11 percent battery while the gt new three lost just eight percent so I don't
                        think
                        the max optimization is making a big difference here
                    </p>

                    <p><b>Software</b><br>
                        now another area where the oneplus 10r is different is the software i mean the software
                        looks
                        the
                        same because oxygen os 12 is basically color os which is basically real me ui but the
                        difference
                        is
                        in terms of bloatware and ads the gt neo3 comes with a ton of bloatware apps the 10r is a
                        lot
                        cleaner compared to that there's only netflix and spotify the gt93 also has these ads on the
                        lock
                        screen the 10r does not the 10r is also promised to get three major android updates and four
                        years
                        of security patches which is better than what really promised for the gt neo3 the one large
                        difference between these two phones is the pricing the gt neo3 is priced 2000 less than the
                        oneplus
                        10 look oneplus phones have always been oppo phones rebranded we all know that and we've
                        been
                        fine
                        with it because oneplus used to take oppo phones make some good changes to it and launch it
                        at
                        good
                        affordable prices the oneplus 10r is the opposite of that this is just a bad rebranding of
                        the
                        gt93
                        with higher pricing and i don't really know what's going on here

                        <b>Final Verdict</b><br>
                        to be very honest this is not an outright bad phone it is decent-ish but it just does not
                        feel
                        like
                        a one plus smartphone maybe because of its unsettling design choices higher than competitive
