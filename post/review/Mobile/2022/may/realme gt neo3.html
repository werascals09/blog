                <p class="post-text-lower">This is the realme gt neo3 and this comes in two variants with 80-watt fast
                    charging and a variant with 150-watt fast charging we have the 150-watt one and this has two
                    exciting features one is obviously the crazy fast 150-watt charging and the second is the new
                    powerful diminishing 8100 chipset so let's check it out.


                </p>

                <br>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>OverView</b><br>
                    This is the real me gt new 3 and I'll talk about the other aspects of this phone but I'm going to
                    start with two exciting features the REALME gt neo 3 has a 4500 mah battery but that's kind of fine
                    normal what's interesting is that this phone comes with a 150-watt ultra dart charger this is a big
                    ass charger it's a USB-C PD charger
                    <br>
                <p>

                </p>

                </p>
                </p>
                <BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    Plus another interesting thing about this is that this is actually a 160-watt charger if you look
                    closely you can see the 20 volts 8-ampere decks which basically means 160 watts the truth is this is
                    a 160-watt GaN charger but discharges at 150 watts now if you're wondering what GaN is, well GaN
                    chargers are smaller in size faster but more energy efficient.


                </p>
                </p>
                <BR></BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    <b>Battery & Charging</b><br>
                    Anyway let's get to the point how fast is this 150 watt charger so i put the gt neo3 with this 150
                    watt ultra dot charger versus xiaomi 11i and it's 120 watt hyper charger now I started the test at
                    10% and after just two minutes the gt neo 3 is already a 30% charge but what's interesting is that
                    the xiaomi 11i is also close at 28% with its 120 watt charger now realme had claimed 50%in five
                    minutes but after five minutes the gt new three is 46 percent still impressive but yeah falls a bit
                    short now what's interesting again is that the xiaomi 11i is ahead of the gt neo3 at 47 battery now
                    do note that I had enabled rapid charge in the gt93 and boost charging speed in the xiaomi 11i.



                </p>
                </p>
                <BR>
                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>

                    Have a charge anyway after 10 minutes the xiaomi 11i is way ahead at 75% while the gt neo3 strangely
                    is quite behind at 65% now this margin cuts down to the end but the xiaomi 11 is 120 watt charger is
                    just faster it charged the phone fully from 10 to 100 percent in 18 minutes while gt neo 3 took 19
                    minutes i know it's a difference of only a minute but i was honestly expecting the 150 watt charger
                    to beat the 120 watt charger strangely i'm not sure what's happening here

                <p>
                    because we did the charging test again and the results were kind of similar now you must have
                    noticed that this phone has a rapid charging option that you can enable but when i tested things the
                    charging speed without the rapid charging mode was faster the phone took 19 minutes with the rapid
                    mode on and it took 16 minutes to go from 10 to 100 with rapid charging off basically the 150 watt
                    ultra charger is crazy fast i mean 16 to 19 minutes to fully charge the phone is still insane but
                    the truth is it does not be the 120 watt hyper charger on the xiaomi 11 i hyper charge which is a
                    bit weird as for the battery



                </p>
                </p>

                <br>

                <p class="post-text-lower" style="line-height: 30px;">
                <p>
                    health and heating we did not come across any heating issues the phone was normal during charging
                    and as for the battery health the gt neo3 has the tube weed island safe fast charging system
                    certification and is also said to be 38 layers of safety and really says that the battery will keep
                    80 percent of its lifespan after 1600 charge in discharge cycles now this sounds better because i
                    remember xiaomi saying the same 80 number but after 800 cycles with the 120 watt hyper charge



                </p>

                    <!-- <h3>Speaker</h3> -->
                <p><b>Performance</b><br>

                    Now coming to the second big highlight the gt neo3 is the first phone we have tested with the new
                    temensity 8100 chipset yeah the oneplus 10r isn't here yet now the density 8100 is based on the
                    tsmc's five nanometer process and along with the new chipset there's fast lp ddr5 ram and ufs 3.1
                    storage anyway the focus is on the dimension 8100 and when we ran the benchmark scores i found the
                    performance of the diminisity 8100 to be very very close to the snapdragon triple 8, likes the
                    oneplus 9rt i mean here's the end of the score and you can see how close things

                </p>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p class="post-text-lower">
                    <!-- <h3>Speaker</h3> -->
                <p>

                    when it comes to the overall score and the cpu score the snapdragon triplet does better on the gpu
                    front and this is noticeable in the 3d mark score too when it comes to geekbench the triple h scores
                    higher in single core but the dimensi 100 is way ahead in terms of multi-core score we also ran the
                    cpu throttling test i enabled the gt mode on the gt neo 3 and the high performance mode in the
                    oneplus 9 rt

                </p>

                <p>

                    and these are the scores after the 30 minute 50 threads test yeah both these phones performed very
                    well throttling to the same 82 percent the performance numbers on the gt neo3 are higher both the
                    max and the average numbers we also did the 100 threads 1r test and in this test 2 the phones did
                    well the gt neo3 throttled to 79 and the 9rt was marginally better at 81 percent but yeah very close
                    and once again the performance numbers of the gt new 3 are high


                </p>
                </p>

                <p>

                    I also checked the temperatures after the last test and the gt new 3 was around 44 degrees while the
                    9rt was around 42 degrees as for the battery range the gt neo3 lost 27 batteries in this test well
                    the 9rt lost 31 batteries both these phones have the same battery capacity as you know overall the
                    point is the density 8100s performance is very close to the snapdragon triple eight which is very
                    good actually as for optimization in games bgmi only supports HD and high settings on the dimension
                    8100 but other games support the max graphics pubg new state has support for 90 fps gaming like on
                    triple eight cod mobile has a very high graphics and max fps options available but you can't choose
                    both of them together

                <p>

                    this is something you can do in snapdragon triple eight I mean the density 8100 is still a newer
                    chipset so I understand that not all games are optimized for this new chipset but i'm hoping
                    MediaTek works with developers to bring the highest graphic settings in games in these new chipsets
                    these tests and numbers apart when it comes to using the phone the gt nu3 feels like a high-end
                    phone it is fast and snappy when launching apps and multitasking gaming is good too especially
                    something like-new state which supports 90 fps gaming on this phone the phone also has a stainless
                    steel vapor chamber cooling system and

                    <b>Display</b><br>
                    I did notice the phone getting cool after the test more quickly moving on to the other features in
                    the phone the specs of the display are good but more importantly the display looks beautiful the
                    color accuracy is good saw the blacks it's also bright and the high refresh rate is noticeable here
                    the phone also has two speakers which can get quite loud and the clarity is good too the phone has
                    support for wide wine l1 license so there's full HD playback and NetFlix prime video and other apps
                    although there's no hdr support in NetFlix

                <p>
                    <b>Software and UI</b><br>
                    the phone comes with realme UI 2.0 based on Android 12 out of the box and this is also something
                    that helps with the overall smoothness of the phone the animations of the UI seem to be optimized
                    for the 120hz screen and it's nice to use what's not nice is the amount of bloatware in this phone
                    let me go on a rant here I mean first of all there are so many third-party apps pre-installed on the
                    phone and secondly, there are a lot of bloatware apps from real me I mean who needs this browser
                    when there's chrome installed that's all the phone also shows these ads on the lock screen which is
                    insane I mean this is supposed to be a premium high-end phone but these things just ruin the
                    experience

                <p><b>Design</b><br>
                    anyway let's relax for a bit but not too much because I'm also not a big fan of this design I mean I
                    get it looks are subjective so it's totally fine if you like this but I like phones which have a
                    cleaner look like the gt2 pro and do note that the gt neo3 does come in a black variant which does
                    not have these lines that apart this back is a matte ag glass back and the frame is plastic and the
                    phone is good when it comes to size and as for the functionality the fingerprint scanner is in the
                    display and it's good but there's no micro sd slot no headphone jack No wireless charging

                <p><b>Camera</b><br>


                    the camera setup is also fairly good imx 766 has proved to be good on real me phones and from the
                    photos I've taken the camera performance seems good here too be it in the daytime or low light the
                    front camera is a 16-megapixel sensor and here are some selfies from the phone now do note that the
                    rear camera supports 4k 60fps videos so that's good but real me oppo oneplus they're still stuck
                    with 1080p in the front camera

                    when it comes to the connectivity this is a 5g phone with eight 5g bands and support for dual 5g
                    there's also carrier aggregation in fact five ca as you can see which is really good there's also
                    wi-fi six Bluetooth 5.3 and there's NFC as well

                    <b>Final Verdict</b><br>
                    To conclude things I know the oneplus 10 is basically
                    the same phone it's identically done the specs and features and we will be receiving that soon so I
                    think we'll get a better idea on this phone and that once I've used the oneplus 10R that apart as of
                    right now the real gt ne3 does seem like a good all-around package I mean 150-watt charging is not
                    the fastest out there but it's still insanely fast the diminishing 8100 seems like a very solid
                    chipset all around bringing performance on par with the snapdragon triple eight yes a phone in the
                    sub 40k price segment should be more cleaner and there are my opinions on this design but the rest
                    of the phone seems pretty good so far although I'm yet to use the phone as my daily drive
