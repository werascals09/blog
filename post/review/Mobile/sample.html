        you might not be aware but there have

        been a lot of reports suggesting that

        oneplus will be launching a new tablet

        this year in fact some reports say that

        the oneplus tablet is already into mass

        production now generally oneplus devices

        are basically open devices with a few

        changes here and there so you know what

        this

        this could very well be the brand new

        oneplus tablet and i absolutely love it

        so this is actually the new oppo pad

        that has only launched in china but this

        might be the new oneplus tab or oneplus

        pad and i said i love it because if you

        go by the chinese price it starts at

        around 27 000 rupees and for that price

        i think this is a very very good android

        tablet i mean what's the biggest pain

        point of mid-range android tablets it's

        performance and the oppo pad solves that

        and it's not just the performance it's

        actually good all around starting off

        the design is a little bit inspired by

        the ipad air with the whole flat edged

        metal frame design there's the power

        button at the top there's volume rockers

        on the left side and there's a usb 2.0

        usb c port at the bottom also just to

        let you guys know there's no headphone

        jack here anyway the back is glass and

        it has this frosted glass finish with

        this shimmery effect it's matte it's not

        a fingerprint magnet and the finish does

        feel and look premium although i'm a

        little scared about glass backs on the

        tablet i mean this is solidly built

        don't get me wrong but generally most

        tablets are either metal or plastic

        for a reason see generally we like to

        use our tablets carelessly so yeah we

        have been keeping this in a folio case

        that opposes separately this also works

        as a stand so it's really cool all this

        is good but i'm not a big fan of this

        whole branding right here with this

        pattern and i think if this arrives as

        the new oneplus tablet this will be gone

        hopefully there's also a single 30

        megapixel camera here on the back with

        4k support and this camera is kind of

        usable nothing extraordinary but that's

        okay for a tablet on the front the

        bezels are quite slim and there is an

        eight megapixel camera on the top for

        video calls attending meetings or

        classes here's a video from the selfie

        camera

        hey guys this here is a video from the

        front camera of the oppo pad and the

        video quality is decent-ish but i think

        the mic is fairly clear and crisp

        let us know what you think in the

        comments

        the display is a 120 hertz ips lcd and

        the rival android tablet say the tab s7

        fe which costs 40k comes with a 60hz tft

        display

        and what's really interesting is that

        this is actually a very good display for

        the price i mean a lot of us use tablets

        just for movies youtube and even

        browsing the web and this display makes

        sense because the colors are punchy and

        it's fairly bright the spec sheet on the

        oppo website says 480 nits of typical

        brightness but it seems brighter than

        that

        plus the speakers here are really really

        good quad speakers two on each side with

        dolby atmos branding and i wouldn't call

        them the loudest speakers on a tablet

        but the speaker quality is good the bass

        is good and there's a certain depth

        that's actually surprising the display

        is also said to have hdr10 support but

        we import this from china yeah we've

        done a lot of hard work so do not forget

        to hit that bell icon and the subscribe

        button because

        you know you want more exclusive videos

        like this one don't you hit that hit it

        so where was i yeah so chinese variant

        no wide one and one license and no hdr

        support in apps like netflix also this

        is a 120 hertz panel so it feels very

        responsive and smooth to use it also

        supports oppo's own stylus called the

        oppo pencil but i think it only works

        with that or similar styluses because i

        tried the asus pen the s pen from one of

        the galaxy notes and one of these

        styluses and none of them worked now all

        that is fine but what really impressed

        me about this tablet is the specs the

        specs are what actually make this a good

        android tablet ufs 3.1 storage lpdd or

        4x ram but more importantly snapdragon

        870. i think you'll agree when i say

        that the snapdragon 870 was the last

        flagship qualcomm chipset that brought

        consistent high-end performance without

        any issues yeah can't say the same about

        the newer ones

        [Music]

        so 870 is a great choice for this tablet

        especially because it is fairly

        comparable to the ipad 9gens 813 bionic

        and it's definitely better than the 778g

        on the much higher price tab as 7fe

        here's the attitude score and the

        geekbench score the tablet also does

        well in the cpu throttling test app as

        you can see anyway it's not just the

        test or the benchmarks the oppo pad

        feels very smooth and nice to use in day

        to day usage see the last tablets i used

        were the budget ones under 20k for the

        video we did and coming from them this

        is a big difference everything just

        opens up quickly there's no weird

        slowdown anywhere even when running

        multiple apps in the background or

        running apps and split screen game

        performance is also high-end this is

        asphalt on the tablet and i love how it

        looks on this big screen and the

        gameplay is great i also played bgm on

        this tablet misfiring every now and then

        wish i had longer fingers

        but it runs at the highest graphic

        settings ultra hd graphics and ultra

        frame rates and the gameplay was really

        good and it looked great visually too

        the snapdragon 870 also handles all of

        the different color os 12 multitasking

        features with a lot of ease the tablet

        is running color os 12 on top of android

        11 yeah android 11 is a bit

        disappointing but hopefully when this

        launches in india or globally it will

        come with the tablet specific android 12

        well because that would make the

        experience way better anyway color rose

        12 lets you put apps to split screen and

        in a pop-up window in multiple ways

        i can hold an app like this to put it in

        a pop-up window which if you know color

        os you can resize move around etc i can

        also put the apps to split screen from

        the multitasking screen like this but

        also cool gestures i can drag an app

        from the sidebar to open it up in the

        split screen

        i can also swipe down with two fingers

        in an app to split the screen i can also

        do a four finger pinch in an app to get

        it in a floating window now about from

        all of these multitasking gestures i

        also noticed a lot of color rovers apps

        optimized for the bigger screen bringing

        in a dual pane design be the settings

        app

        contacts or notes moving on the overpad

        has a 8360mah battery and it comes with

        this 33 watt super charger in the box

        and the tablet also has support for 18

        watt usb pd charging overall like i said

        at the start the oppo pad seems like a

        very well-rounded android tablet for the

        price the screen the speakers and the

        performance are just really good for a

        tablet that could basically arrive in

        india at under 30k

        this honestly makes me think we've been

        asking xiaomi to bring the me pass to

        india since what feels like eternity and

        that hasn't happened but right now we

        have the perfect me pad alternative in

        the oppo padio i mean with the oppo pad

        oppo has a huge opportunity in india or

        we can launch this in india as the oppo

        pad or even the oneplus pad either ways

        i'm happy because this is an android

        tablet that seems like a great value for

        money device yes for all of those who

        are just going to comment holy horses

        yes there's always the question of ipad

        when it comes to tablets in this price

        range there's the ipad 9gen at 30k which

        does look a bit outdated although it

        does bring all the ipad goodness the

        long-term software support

        but compared to the 9gen ipad the

        overpad has comparable performance a

        more modern design from the front a

        better screen with 120hz refresh rate

        and it has more base storage at 128gb so

        yeah it makes a good case for an android

        tablet so if you guys want this tablet

        in india comment down below share this

        video with oppo oneplus let them know

        that we deserve tablets like these in
